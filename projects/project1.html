                    <p>
                        This project aimed to explore factors influencing the severity of anxiety attacks through the analysis of a dataset containing demographic, occupational, and lifestyle information. The research was structured around three core questions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Who is Most Affected by Anxiety Attacks?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. How do Lifestyle Factors Impact Anxiety?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. What Role do Stress and Major Life Events Play?
                    </p>
                      
                    <ul>
                            <h3>1. Who is Most Affected by Anxiety Attacks?</h3>
                            <p><i>Which age group and gender experience the most severe anxiety attacks?</i></p>
                            <p><i>Are certain occupations more prone to severe attacks?</i></p>
                        <p><strong>Key Goal:</strong>&nbsp;To identify specific age groups, genders, and occupations that are disproportionately affected by anxiety attacks, particularly severe ones.
                        <p><strong>Findings:</strong>&nbsp;The analysis revealed that adults and middle-aged individuals represent a significant portion of individuals experiencing anxiety attacks, with a slight skew towards "Severe" attacks. Overall, "Severe" anxiety attacks were the most prevalent across all categories (Grand Total:&nbsp;~39.9%), followed by "Moderate" (~30.7%) and then "Mild" (~29.4%). Females in these age groups tend to experience slightly higher rates of moderate to severe anxiety compared to males. The unemployed population also showed a higher prevalence of high and severe anxiety attacks, for "High" (~5.4%&nbsp;of the Unemployed) and "Severe" (~1.9%&nbsp;of the Unemployed), potentially linking unemployment to increased anxiety levels.</p>

                            <h3>2. How do Lifestyle Factors Impact Anxiety?</h3>
                                <p><i>Does lack of sleep (&lt;6 hours or deprived) correlate with higher severity?</i></p>
                                <p><i>Do people who exercise more (&gt;5 hours a week), moderate or higher, report milder attacks?</i></p>
                            <p><strong>Key Goal:</strong>&nbsp;To investigate the correlation between lifestyle factors like sleep quality and physical activity levels and the severity of anxiety attacks.</p>
                            <p><strong>Findings:</strong>&nbsp;The analysis suggested that individuals reporting "Abundant" sleep had a relatively low percentage of "Mild" anxiety attacks (~14.1%). In contrast, those with "Enough" (~43.3%) and "Deprived" (~42.6%) sleep showed significantly higher percentages of "Mild" anxiety. Moderate levels of physical activity (categorized as "Light", "Moderate", "High") tended to be associated with lower overall levels of anxiety attack severity across the "Mild", "Moderate", and "Severe" categories. However, the "Very High" fitness group had the highest percentage of "Severe" anxiety (~15.1%), warranting further investigation.</p>

                            <p><i>Are individuals with high stress levels more likely to have severe attack?</i></p>
                        <p><strong>Key Goal:</strong>&nbsp;To determine if individuals with high stress levels are more likely to experience severe anxiety attacks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Findings:</strong>&nbsp;Contrary to expectations, individuals reporting "Severe" stress exhibited the&nbsp;lowest&nbsp;percentages for "Mild", "Moderate", and "Severe" anxiety attacks. The "High", "Minimal", and "Moderate" stress categories showed relatively consistent anxiety severity distributions, with each category registering around&nbsp;8-10%&nbsp;for "Mild" and "Moderate" anxiety, and&nbsp;11-13%&nbsp;for "Severe" anxiety. This unexpected result suggests a more complex relationship between self-reported stress and anxiety.</p>

                <h3>Overall Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p>This project quantified potential relationships between demographic factors, occupation, lifestyle choices, and anxiety attack severity. The findings included a significantly lower amount of anxiety in "Severe" stress, an increase of anxiety when there is lack of sleep, and a balance in fitness.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that these results are based solely on the provided dataset and may not be generalizable to broader populations. While further research is needed to establish causation and control for confounding variables, the findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted interventions and guiding future research into the complex factors contributing to anxiety.</p>
